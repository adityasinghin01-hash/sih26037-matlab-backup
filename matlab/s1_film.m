%S1_FILM  PHASE 4 - the S1 film. MP4, chase camera, live HUD.
%
%   THE WORLD IS NOT REDRAWN EVERY FRAME. It is static; only the camera and the actors
%   move. Redrawing 1,400 instanced trees 1,488 times is what would make this an hour
%   instead of minutes, so the world is rebuilt only when the ego has travelled far
%   enough to need a new cull window, and between rebuilds only the actor patches are
%   deleted and redrawn.

% MEMORY BUDGET. This is an 8 GB machine and the world got much heavier when the
% Blender-authored assets went in - an authored neem is 1,604 triangles against the
% primitive's ~117. The first attempt at a film after that was KILLED BY THE SYSTEM
% partway through, leaving a truncated MP4. Two things fixed it, and neither costs
% anything a chase camera can see:
%   - a smaller detail radius, so fewer authored trees are resident per rebuild
%   - a larger refocus distance, so the world is rebuilt less often
% The stills still render at full detail; it is only the 1,486-frame loop that cannot
% afford it.
clear OBS                               %#ok<CLEAR>  the per-step obstacle lists
%   NOT `poses` - the film reads it every frame. Clearing it was my own error and
%   it killed the run at line 49 with 'Unrecognized function or variable'.


% SPEED PASS, 6 Sep - Aditya asked to render as fast as possible on the Mac rather
% than move to the lab (MATLAB here is CPU/OpenGL, the lab GPU would not help
% anyway). FIRST ATTEMPT tightened RAD 85->70 and DET 28->20 alongside the FPS cut -
% REVERTED. It introduced a ONE-FRAME glitch at t~60s (a huge indistinct green
% blob filling the frame, gone one frame either side) that is NOT present in the
% original 85/28 render - almost certainly a camera/geometry clash right at a
% world-rebuild boundary, made reachable by the smaller cull radius. Not root-caused
% under deadline pressure; reverted rather than shipped with an unexplained glitch
% in a judged demo. FPS alone (24->18) is the safe lever - it changes frame COUNT,
% not culling or rebuild geometry, so it cannot introduce this class of bug.
