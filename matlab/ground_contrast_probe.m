%GROUND_CONTRAST_PROBE  Measure the real ground's (shoulder/verge/forest-floor) local
%   contrast off Aditya's own dashcam frames, at MATCHED metres-per-pixel, so
%   sc.groundTexture's amplitude is SOLVED rather than guessed - the same
%   discipline REF-17 s22b used for the road ("the largest available win" turned
%   out to be a smaller one once measured), applied here because nobody has
%   measured the ground yet (REF-17 s19j: "Phase 5's GROUND half... has not been
%   measured and may now be the better half of it").
%
%   THREE PASSES, TIGHTER EACH TIME - same tell as the road: every refinement
%   LOWERS the number, because a brighter intruder (sky, a vehicle body, a
%   painted marking) only ever ADDS contrast it should not be carrying.
%     pass 1  naive fixed rectangle, lower-left of frame          - contaminated
%     pass 2  best-of-N candidate per frame by vegetation/earth score - still some
%     pass 3  + reject sky / flat-grey (road, vehicle paint) / shadow / blown
%             highlight / near-uniform patches, at MATCHED metres-per-pixel
%
%   CONTACT-SHEETED: every crop pass 3 ACCEPTS is written to one image and must
%   be LOOKED AT before the number is trusted (matlab-render-hazards memory s4 -
%   "the single sample I checked after pass 1 was visibly grass").
%
%   CAMERA ASSUMPTIONS, STATED SO THEY CAN BE CHALLENGED RATHER THAN HIDDEN:
%     - 140 deg horizontal FOV, rectilinear first-order (REF-01 s12: corrected
%       from an earlier wrong 24 mm-equivalent assumption)
%     - 1.35 m mount height - THIS IS NOT A MEASURED DASHCAM FIGURE. It is this
%       project's own driver-eye height (used elsewhere for the render camera),
%       reused here for lack of anything better. Flagged in the printed report,
%       not silently assumed.
%     - level camera (horizon at the vertical centre row) - a dashcam pitches
%       with the vehicle in reality; not modelled.
%   Every one of these is a FIRST-ORDER approximation, exactly as this project's
%   own "140 deg dashcam = 8 mm equivalent, rectilinear" already is elsewhere.
%   4 of 64 frames (the drive_01 clip) are PORTRAIT (478x850, no EXIF tag to
%   explain it) and are excluded rather than guessed-rotated.
